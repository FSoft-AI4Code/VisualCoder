Let's analyze the given Python code step by step and compare it with the control flow graph (CFG) to identify the problematic line.

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   S = ['1', '2', '1', '4']
   K = 4
   ```
   - This line initializes the list `S` to `['1', '2', '1', '4']` and the variable `K` to `4`. This corresponds to the node at the top of the CFG.

2. **First `if` statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(K)):
       if S[i]!= 1:
           print(S[i])
           exit()
   ```
   - This line iterates over the indices of `K` and checks if the element at index `i` in `S` is not equal to `1`. If it is not equal to `1`, it prints the element and exits the loop. This corresponds to the first `if` node in the CFG.

3. **Second `if` statement:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```
   - This line prints `1`. This corresponds to the second `if` node in the CFG.

Now, let's identify the problematic line:

- The first `if` statement uses the `!=` operator to check if the element at index `i` in `S` is not equal to `1`. This corresponds to the first `if` node in the CFG.

- The second `if` statement prints `1`. This corresponds to the second `if` node in the CFG.

Therefore, the problematic line is:

**2: print(1)**
